    "In recent decades the study of complex networks has taken a surge in scientific development. This originates from the analysis of complex networks featuring prominently in the study of dynamics of biological or social systems, where connections between the characteristics of systems have been made to the properties of the corresponding network.\n",

    "Recently there were links drawn between the regulation of lipids and their circular network structure, indicating that global ring structures play a significant role in understanding biological processes, see [<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415006418\">Marielle S.

    "\n",
    "Furthermore recent techniques from computational topology, namely \"persistent homology\", were developed to record topological structures in data. This technique differs from classical community detection in networks, where different thresholds are optimized to find specific structures. Instead the network gets analyzed over a wide range of threshholds to record changes in the network properties. Historically this technique was not developed for networks specifically, but it turns out to be effectively applied in the study of complex networks. There are numerous examples of different applications see for example.[<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.2203.pdf\">Danijela Horak, S. Maletić, M. Rajković; Persistent homology of complex networks</a>]\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project was to give a presentation in the form of a video, explaining the combination of persistent homology and its application of detecting ring structures in networks.\n",
    "This report will therefore briefly discuss the methods and data sources used, in particular a guide to our project's corresponding github repository will be given [<a href=\"https://github.com/maxstolly/Complex-Network-Analysis-Project\">GitHub link</a>]. Furthermore the report closes with a discussion about the results and the personal experiences of the work-process."

    "We start with a weighted Graph $G = (V, E)$ with weights $(\\omega_e)_{e \\in E}$. For a threshold $\\tau$ the weighted Graph $G$ gives an unweighted Graph $\\tilde G (\\tau)$ by simply deleting all the edges with weight $\\omega > \\tau$. Doing this iteratively for a sequence of weights $\\tau_0 < \\tau_1 < \\tau_2 < ...$ gives a so-called $Graph filtration:$ $\\tilde G (\\tau_0) \\subseteq \\tilde G (\\tau_1) \\subseteq \\tilde G (\\tau_2) \\subseteq ...$. From this Graph filtration a filtration of $simplical \\ comlexes$ is constructed to record topoligcal information in higher dimensional spaces, most commonly used is the $Vietoris-Rips-Complex$.

Note that distances in complex networks may not be euclidean, but distances of nodes in networks are given by the weights of the edges. If no weights are existent, they can be artifically be assigned through the means of a centrality measure."
